# Ecosystem Simulation - Savanna

## Project Description
"Ecosystem Simulation" is an interactive simulation where animals and plants with various characteristics are placed on a board with defined dimensions. This simulation allows observation of how the animals initially move randomly, and their movements evolve under the influence of various environmental factors.

## Components of the Simulation
- **Simulation**: The main module managing the simulation.
- **Animal**: Defines the behaviors and properties of animals.
- **Plants**: Describes different types of plants and their impact on the board.
- **Map**: Represents the space where the simulation takes place.
- **ApplicationData**: Manages data and the state of the application.
- **Animal Interactions**: In the simulation, animals can hide or increase their statistics through the presence of plants.

The project includes a variety of interactions between these elements of the ecosystem.
